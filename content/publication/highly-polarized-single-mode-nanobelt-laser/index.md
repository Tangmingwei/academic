abstract: We demonstrate a highly polarized single mode nanobelt laser with a
  low threshold. Different from the traditional nanobelt lasers, the laser
  cavity is formed along the lateral direction of the nanobelt and the
  wavelength is centered at 712.6 nm with a linewidth of about 0.18 nm. The
  single mode lasing emission is highly polarized with a polarization ratio of
  about 0.91. Moreover, the threshold is as low as 18 μJ/cm2 which is about an
  order of magnitude lower than that of the traditional CdSe nanobelt lasers.
  These low threshold high polarization single mode nanobelt lasers offer great
  potential as a low cost and energy efficient choice of technology for
  applications in visible light communications, displays, optical sensing, and
  environmental monitoring.
