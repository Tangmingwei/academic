abstract: Linear super-resolution microscopy via synthesis aperture approach
  permits fast acquisition owing to its wide-field implementations. However, it
  has been limited in resolution because a spatial-frequency band missing occurs
  when trying to use a shift magnitude surpassing the cutoff frequency of the
  detection system beyond a factor of two, which distorts the image severely.
  Here, we propose a method of chip-based 3D nanoscopy through a tunable
  spatial-frequency-shift effect capable of covering the full extent of the
  spatial-frequency component within a wide passband. The missing of the spatial
  spectrum can be effectively solved by developing a spatial-frequency-shift
  active tuning approach through wave vector manipulation and operation of
  optical modes propagating along multiple azimuthal directions on a waveguide
  chip. Besides, the method includes a chip-based sectioning capability, which
  is enabled by the saturated absorption of fluorophores.
