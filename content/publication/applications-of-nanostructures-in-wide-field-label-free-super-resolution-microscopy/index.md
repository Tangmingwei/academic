abstract: Super resolution imaging capable of resolving details beyond the
  diffraction limit is highly desired in many scientific and application fields,
  including bio-medicine, nanomaterial science, and opto-electronic integration.
  Up to now, many different methods have been proposed, among which wide-field,
  label-free super resolution microscopy is indispensable due to its good
  applicability to diverse sample types, large field of view (FOV), and high
  imaging speed. In recent years, nanostructures have made a crucial
  contribution to the wide-field, label-free subdiffraction microscopy, with
  various working mechanisms and configuration designs. This review summarizes
  the recent applications of the nanostructures in the wide-field, label-free
  super resolution microscopy, with the emphasis on the designs of hyperlens
  with hyperbolic dispersion, microsphere with "nano-jets", and nanowire ring
  illumination microscopy based on spatial frequency shift effect. The
  bottlenecks of the current techniques and possible solutions are also
  discussed.
