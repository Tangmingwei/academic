abstract: Wide field-of-view (FOV), label-free, super-resolution imaging is
  demonstrated using a specially designed waveguide chip that can illuminate a
  sample with multicolor evanescent waves travelling along different directions.
  The method is enabled by a polymer fluorescent film that emits over a broad
  wavelength range. Its polygonal geometry ensures coverage over all
  illumination directions, enabling high-fidelity image reconstruction while
  minimizing distortion and image blurring. By frequency shifting and iterative
  stitching of different spatial frequencies in Fourier space, the
  reconstruction of 2D samples is achieved without distortion over wide FOVs.
  The fabrication process is facile and compatible with conventional
  semiconductor-fabrication methods. The super-resolution chip (SRC) can thus be
  produced with high yield, offering opportunities for potential conjunction of
  super-resolution techniques integrated optical circuits or for the development
  of single-use diagnostic kits.
