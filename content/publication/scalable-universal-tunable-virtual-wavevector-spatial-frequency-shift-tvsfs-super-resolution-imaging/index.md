abstract: Developing a chip-based super-resolution imaging technique with large
  field-of-view (FOV), deep subwavelength resolution, and compatibility for both
  fluorescent and non-fluorescent samples is desired for material science,
  biomedicine, and life researches, etc. Previous on-chip super-resolution
  methods focus on either fluorescent or non-fluorescent imaging, putting an
  urgent requirement on the general imaging technique compatible with both of
  them. Here, we introduce a universal super-resolution imaging method based on
  tunable virtual-wavevector spatial frequency shift (TVSFS), realizing both
  labeled and label-free super-resolution imaging on a single delicately
  fabricated scalable photonic chip. Theoretically, with TVSFS, the diffraction
  limit of a linear optical system can be overcome, and the resolution can be
  improved more than three times, which is the limitation for most
  super-resolution imaging based on spatial frequency engineering. Diffractive
  units were fabricated on the chip's surface to provide a wavevector-variable
  evanescent wave illumination and induce tunable deep SFS in the samples'
  Fourier space. A resolution of {\lambda}/4.7 for the label-free sample and
  {\lambda}/7.1 for the labeled sample with a large FOV could be achieved with a
  CMOS-compatible process on a GaP chip. The large FOV, high-compatibility, and
  high-integration TVSFS chip may advance the fields like cell engineering,
  precision inspection in the industry, chemical research, etc.
