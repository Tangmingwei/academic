abstract: The main challenge in multimode fiber imaging is modal scrambling
  caused by environmental fluctuation. How to get high contrast and high stable
  imaging is the main question. In this presentation, we propose some methods to
  increase the contrast-to-noise ratio and stability of multimode fiber imaging.
  Wavelength modulation is introduced to suppress the background. Exhaustive
  bending effect was used to improve the imaging stability. Wavelength
  modulation is introduced to enhance the CNR four fold in a 200 μm
  field-of-view imaging. We show a near diffraction limited focusing capability
  at imaging depths of up to 150 µm with near constant lateral resolutions of
  2.1 µm. The imaging of small fluorescent beads embedded in a 3D matrix was
  demonstrated.
