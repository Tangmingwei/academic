abstract: The coupling of mechanics/electronics/photonics may improve the
  performance of nanophotonic devices not only in the linear region but also in
  the nonlinear region. This review letter mainly presents the recent advances
  on multi-field coupling in nonlinear photonic devices. The nonlinear
  piezoelectric effect and piezo-phototronic effects in quantum wells and fibers
  show that large second-order nonlinear susceptibilities can be achieved, and
  second harmonic generation and electro-optic modulation can be enhanced and
  modulated. Strain engineering can tune the lattice structures and induce
  second order susceptibilities in central symmetry semiconductors. By combining
  the absorption-based photoacoustic effect and intensity-dependent
  photobleaching effect, subdiffraction imaging can be achieved. This review
  will also discuss possible future applications of these novel effects and the
  perspective of their research. The review can help us develop a deeper
  knowledge of the substance of photon–electron–phonon interaction in a
  micro-/nano- system. Moreover, it can benefit the design of nonlinear optical
  sensors and imaging devices with a faster response rate, higher efficiency,
  more sensitivity and higher spatial resolution which could be applied in
  environmental detection, bio-sensors, medical imaging and so on.
