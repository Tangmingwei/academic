abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor nanostructure-based photodetectors
  show high sensitivity but suffer from slow response speed due to surface
  reaction. Here, we report a fast-response CdS-CdSxTe1−x-CdTe core-shell
  nanobelt photodetector with a rise time of 11 μs, which is the fastest among
  CdS based photodetectors reported previously. The improved response speed is
  ascribed to the suppressed possibilities of surface reaction resulting from
  the core-shell structure and heterojunction among the CdS, CdSxTe1−x and CdTe.
  The measured response spectrum of CdS-CdSxTe1−x-CdTe core-shell nanobelt
  photodetector covers a wide range from 355 to 785 nm. Moreover, high
  responsivity (1,520 A/W) and large 3 dB bandwidth (∼22.9 kHz) are obtained
  along with the fast response. The high performance in responsivity,
  sensitivity, spectral response and photoresponse speed makes this device a
  promising candidate for practical application in optical sensing,
  communication and imaging.
