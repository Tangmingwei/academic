abstract: The diffraction limit substantially impedes the resolution of the
  conventional optical microscope. Under traditional illumination, the
  high-spatial-frequency light corresponding to the subwavelength information of
  objects is located in the near-field in the form of evanescent waves, and thus
  not detectable by conventional far-field objectives. Recent advances in
  nanomaterials and metamaterials provide new approaches to break this
  limitation by utilizing large-wavevector evanescent waves. Here, a
  comprehensive review of this emerging and fast-growing field is presented. The
  current superresolution imaging techniques based on evanescent-wave-assisted
  spatial frequency modulation, including hyperlens, microsphere lens, and
  evanescent field-illuminated spatial frequency shift microscopy, are
  illustrated. They are promising in investigating unobserved details and
  processes in fields such as medicine, biology, and material research. Some
  current challenges and future possibilities of these superresolution methods
  are also discussed.
