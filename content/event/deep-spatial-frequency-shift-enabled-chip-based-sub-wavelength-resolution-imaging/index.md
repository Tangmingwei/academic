title: Deep spatial frequency shift enabled chip-based sub-wavelength-resolution
  imaging
abstract: >
  The spatial frequency shift (SFS) method has been extensively studied to
  achieve on-chip fast superresolution imaging for its wide-field implement.
  Theoretically, the resolution can reach down to the nanoscopy regime by
  introducing ultra large-wavevector illumination. However, it is not achieved
  experimentally because the lack of tunability in the illumination wavevector
  still restrains the practical resolution of the spatial frequency shift
  method. 

  Here, we introduce a superresolution imaging method, realizing on a single elaborately fabricated chip. With delicate design and fabrication, the photonic chip can realize wavevector-variable evanescent wave illumination and tunable spatial frequency shift in the samplesâ€™ Fourier space. The chip is based on high refractive index contrast dielectric, with barely any loss at the chosen visible wavelength, allowing a large field-of-view (FOV) imaging. We also designed and analyzed photonic chip based on plasmon materials for superresolution imaging theoretically. With the ultra-large wavevector generated by surface plasmon, this kind of photonic chip can realize sub-30 nm lateral resolution. 

  Besides generating precise evanescent waves for illumination, the SFS chips also function as the sample holder, releasing the complexity of the optical path. We expect this SFS chip will advance the development of the biological, medical, and material study.
