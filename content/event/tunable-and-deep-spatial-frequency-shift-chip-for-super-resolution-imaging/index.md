title: Tunable and deep spatial frequency shift chip for super-resolution imaging
abstract: In the linear spatial frequency shift (SFS) super-resolution imaging,
  when the magnitude of SFS exceeds twice the detection aperture, there will be
  a missing of spatial frequency. For this reason, a tunable and deep SFS
  imaging method based on optical chips has been developed to realize the
  precise multi-level control of the magnitude and direction of the illumination
  evanescent field's wavevector. In this presentation, we present our recent
  work on tunable deep-SFS SR chip to achieve a resolution beyond 3 times the
  Abbe diffraction limit. Two methods of tunable deep-SFS imaging based on
  optical chips have been developed, one using Gallium Phosphide (GaP)
  integrated optical waveguide chip, with which three-dimensional SR imaging of
  fluorescently labeled samples can be achieved; another is based on a
  wafer-scale universally tunable deep-SFS SR microscopy imaging chip, which is
  suitable for 2D imaging of both label-free and labeled samples.
