abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures such as nanowires,
  nanobelts and nanorods have attracted lots of attention for the excellent,
  unique electrical and optical characteristics such as high carrier mobility
  and small size. In this work, CdS-CdTe nanobelt photodetectors were fabricated
  by a two-step Chemical vapor deposition method with a
  metal-semiconductor-metal structure. We show that the CdS-CdTe nanobelt
  photodetector has a fast photoresponse as short as 4.3us, which is almost two
  orders of magnitude shorter than that of pure CdS nanobelt photodetectors. The
  fast photoresponse is due to the forming of core shell structure and
  heterojunction between CdS and CdTe. Moreover, the responsivity and
  sensitivity have been improved. The high performance in responsivity,
  sensitivity and photoresponse speed makes this device promising candidate for
  practical application in future optical sensing, communication and imaging.
