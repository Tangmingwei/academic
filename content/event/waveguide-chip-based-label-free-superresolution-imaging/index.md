title: Waveguide chip-based label-free superresolution imaging
abstract: Recently, super-resolution imaging methods based on frequency-shift
  has attracted the interest of researchers from different areas. The advantages
  of these techniques, like wide field of view (FOV), fast imaging speed and
  compatibility with labeled or label-free samples, make them a potential
  candidate for future applications. To achieve a super-resolution image of the
  sample, wide spatial frequency information of the sample should be provided.
  Here, we demonstrate a novel super-resolution chip based on the evanescent
  illumination occurred at the surface of a thick waveguide. In this design,
  only a single wavelength is used for illumination. The illumination wave
  vectors are tuned by designing gratings with different periods to change the
  angle of total internal reflection. Compared with our previous works, the
  fabrication process is easier, and because of the larger illumination wave
  vectors, a resolution better than Î»/3.7 has been achieved in this new design.
